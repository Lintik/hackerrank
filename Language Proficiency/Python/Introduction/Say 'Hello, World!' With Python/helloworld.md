Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
```

The above code will print `Hello, World!` on your screen. Try it yourself in the editor below!
