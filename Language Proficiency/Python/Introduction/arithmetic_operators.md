__Task__

The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, $a$ and $b$. Add code to print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

__Example__

$a = 3$

$b = 5$

Print the following:
```python
8
-2
15
```
__Input Format__

The first line contains the first integer, $a$
.
The second line contains the second integer, $b$.

__Constraints__

$1 \le a \le 10^{\mathrm{10}}.$

$1 \le b \le 10^{\mathrm{10}}.$ 

__Output Format__

Print the three lines as explained above.

__Sample Input 0__
```python
3
2
```
__Sample Output 0__
```python
5
1
6
```
__Explanation 0__

$3 + 2 \Longrightarrow 5$ 

$3 - 2 \Longrightarrow 1$
