__Task__

The provided code stub reads two integers, $a$ and $b$, from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, $a  //  b$. The second line should contain the result of float division, $a / b$.

No rounding or formatting is necessary.

__Example__

$a = 3$

$b = 5$

* The result of the integer division $3//5 = 0$.
* The result of the float division is $3/5 = 0.6$.

Print:
```python
0
0.6
```
__Input Format__

The first line contains the first integer, $a$.

The second line contains the second integer, $b$.

__Output Format__

Print the two lines as described above.

__Sample Input 0__
```python
4
3
```
__Sample Output 0__
```python
1
1.33333333333
```
