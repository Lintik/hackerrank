The included code stub will read an integer, $n$, from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:

$1 2 3 \cdots n$

Note that "$\cdots$" represents the consecutive values in between.

__Example__

$n = 5$

Print the string $12345$.

__Input Format__

The first line contains an integer $n$.

__Constraints__


$ 1 \le n \le 150$

__Output Format__

Print the list of integers from $1$ through $n$ as a string, without spaces.

__Sample Input 0__
```python

```
__Sample Output 0__
```python
